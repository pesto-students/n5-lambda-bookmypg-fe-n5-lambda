**About The Project**
---------------------

With the need of people who work away from their home and face lots of
difficulties in hunting for accommodation in a new city or location, the
goal of this system is to facilitate them with hassle-free paying guest
services with managing reminders for rent every month and auto payments.
The proposed system will also provide the PG - Owner a huge online
platform to find the Paying Guests effortlessly.
